<h1>Giving and Receiving</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>


<p>
<dl>
<dt>(A) A person the speaker considers to be @KT{{soto}} is given something:
<li><em>giver</em> @HI{{ha}} <em>receiver (@KT{{soto}})</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{sashiageru}}</strong> <em>&starf;</em>
<li><em>giver</em> @HI{{ha}} <em>receiver (@KT{{soto}})</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{ageru}}</strong>
<li><em>giver</em> @HI{{ha}} <em>receiver</em>               @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{yaru}}</strong>
<p></p>
<dt>(B) The speaker or a person the speaker considers to be @KT{{uchi}} receives something:
<li><em>receiver (@KT{{uchi}}) </em> @HI{{ha}} <em>giver</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{itadaku}}</strong> <em>&#x203B;</em>
<li><em>receiver (@KT{{uchi}}) </em> @HI{{ha}} <em>giver</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{morau}}</strong>
<p></p>
<dt>(C) A person the speaker considers to be @KT{{uchi}} is given something:
<li><em>giver (@KT{{uchi}})</em> @HI{{ha}} <em>receiver</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{kudasaru}}</strong> <em>&#x203B;</em>
<li><em>giver (@KT{{uchi}})</em> @HI{{ha}} <em>receiver</em> @HI{{ni}} @N1{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@HI{{kureru}}</strong>
</p>

&starf; @HI{{sashiageru}} is the humble form of @HI{{ageru}} and is used when showing respect to the receiver.
<p></p>
&#x203B; humble form used to show respect to the other party
<p></p>

<h2> Definition </h2>

@HI{{ageru}} is used when something is given by the speaker, or someone with whom the speaker empathises, to someone not
part of the speaker's in-group. The giver is the subject and the receiver is marked with @HI{{ni}}.
<p></p>
@HI{{sashiageru}} is the humble form of @HI{{ageru}} and is used to show respect to the receiver.
<p></p>
@HI{{yaru}} is used when the giver is in a higher position than the receiver or when the receiver is a person close to the speaker.
<p></p>

@HI{{morau}} is used when the speaker, or someone with whom the speaker empathises, receives something from someone the speaker considers to
be @KT{{soto}}. The receiver is the subject and the giver is marked with @HI{{ni}} (or sometimes with @HI{{kara}}).
<p></p>
@HI{{itadaku}} is the humble polite version of @HI{{morau}} used to show respect to the giver.
<p></p>

@HI{{kureru}} is used when the speaker, or someone with whom the speaker empathises, is given something by someone else.
The giver is the subject and the receiver is marked by @HI{{ni}}.
<p></p>
@HI{{kudasaru}} is the honorific polite version of @HI{{morau}} used to show respect to the giver.

<h2> Examples </h2>

<h2> Notes </h2>

@HI{{ageru}} requires the speaker's point of view or a neutral point of view, so if the recipient is the speaker or
part of the speaker's in-group (@KT{{uchi}}) then a conflict arises and the sentence is ungrammatical.
<p></p>

@HI{{morau}} requires the receiver's point of view. So if the giver is the speaker, a conflict arises. Therefore @HI{{morau}} is only
used if the giver is not the speaker or part of the speaker's in-group. In the event that the giver is an organisation, @HI{{kara}} is
more likely to be used.
<p></p>

@HI{{kureru}} is only used when the receiver is the speaker or someone with whom the speaker empathises. It cannot be used when the
giver is the speaker or someone with whom the speaker empathises, even if the giver is also such a person; in this case @HI{{ageru}}
must be used.
