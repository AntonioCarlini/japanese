<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
@HI{{ageru}} requires the speaker's point of view or a neutral point of view, so if the recipient is the speaker or
part of the speaker's in-group (@KT{{uchi}}) then a conflict arises and the sentence is ungrammatical.
</p>

<p>
@HI{{morau}} requires the receiver's point of view. So if the giver is the speaker, a conflict arises. Therefore @HI{{morau}} is only
used if the giver is not the speaker or part of the speaker's in-group. In the event that the giver is an organisation, @HI{{kara}} is
more likely to be used.
</p>

<p>
@HI{{kureru}} is only used when the receiver is the speaker or someone with whom the speaker empathises. It cannot be used when the
giver is the speaker or someone with whom the speaker empathises, even if the giver is also such a person; in this case @HI{{ageru}}
must be used.
