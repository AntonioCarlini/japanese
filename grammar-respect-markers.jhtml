<h1>Polite Suffixes</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> <em>name or noun</em><strong>@HI{{sann}}</strong>
<li> <strong>@HI{{o}}</strong>@N{{}}
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
<a name="san"><strong>@HI{{sann}}</strong></a> is added as a suffix to the name of the listener or to a third person, or to nouns
describing these, to show the speaker's respect for the person. It is <em>never</em> used by the speaker when
referring to himself. Note that in Japanese speech the pronoun for "you", @HI{{anata}}, is not often used;
instead refer to the listener by using their family name followed by @HI{{sann}} or by an appropriate title.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{ano@KJ{{direction}}ha @KT{{mira-}}<strong>sann</strong>desu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      That's Mr. Miller.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<a name="kun"><strong>@HI{{kunn}}</strong></a> is added as a suffix to the first or last name of a male of equal rank or to the first or last name
of a person of lower rank. This suffix is often used in schools and at work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="o"><strong>@HI{{o}}</strong></a> can be added to some words in order to show respect for another person.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{<strong>o</strong>@KJ{{country}}hadochiradesuka.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Where are you from?
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<strong>@HI{{o}}</strong> cannot be used with nouns or adjectives that already begin with @HI{{o}}, with loan words
or with foreign words. There are a very few exceptions to this rule.
</p>

<p>
<a name="go"><strong>@HI{{go}}</strong></a> can be added to some words in order to show respect for another person.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
There are some words where an initial @HI{{o}} is used as a matter of course and no longer indicates any particular respect.
Common examples are @HI{{ocha}} and @HI{{okane}}.
