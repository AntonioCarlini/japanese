<h1>Use of the Imperative and Prohibitive</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @N{{person}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@Vsaseru{{}}</strong>(intransitive)
<li> @N{{person}} @HI{{ni}} @N{{}} @HI{{wo}} <strong>@Vsaseru{{}}</strong>(transitive)
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
The imperative is used to command a person to do something and the prohibitive form is used to order
a person not to do something. Both forms have strong coercive overtones and as such their use is
limited.
</br>
They can be used :
<ol>
<li> by a father to his children
<li> by a senior man to his juniors
<li> between males who are friends (in which case the sentence ending particle @HI{{yo}} is often
used to soften the utterance)
<li> in situations when there is not enough time to be polite (for example, an emergency)
<li> when giving instructions to a large number of people
<li> when a command is required during training
<li> when cheering at sports events
<li> when a strong impact or brevity is required, such as in traffic signs
</ol>
</p>

<h2> Examples </h2>

<ol>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{early}}ku @KJ{{sleep}}ro}}.
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Go to bed immediately.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{amari @KJ{{drink}}munayo.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Don't drink too much.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{escape}}ro.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Run!
  </td> </tr>
</table>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{rest}}na.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Don't rest.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{stop}}mare.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Stop.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</ol>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
Women do not usually use the imperative, instead they usually use @Vmasu{{}} @HI{{nasai}} when a male would
employ the imperative.
