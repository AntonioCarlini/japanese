<h1>Giving and Receiving Actions</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{ageru}}
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{morau}}
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{kureru}}
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{yaru}}
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{itadaku}}
<li> @Vte{{}} @HI{{kudasaru}}
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{ageru}} is used when something is done by the speaker for someone with a sense of goodwill. When the
doer is the speaker and the receiver of the action is the listener, this could give the impression that
the speaker is being patronising. Under these circumstances the expression should only be used to
someone the speaker is close. Otherwise the speaker should use @Vmasustem{{}}@HI{{mashouka}} instead.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{morau}} is used to indicate that the speaker has had something done for him (has received an action).
The expression conveys a sense of gratitude on the part of the receiver.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{kureru}} indicates that an action is performed for the speaker. Like @Vte{{}}@HI{{morau}},
this expression conveys a sense of gratitude on the part of the receiver. The difference is that the
subject of the sentence if the performer of the action, implying that the actor has performed the
action voluntarily.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{yaru}} has the same basic meaning as @Vte{{}}@HI{{ageru}}. It is used when the 
giver is in a higher position than the receiver or when the receiver is a person close to the speaker.
@Vte{{}}@HI{{yaru}}, like @Vte{{}}@HI{{ageru}}, may leave an impression of arrogance under some circumstances.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{itadaku}} is the humble form of @Vte{{}}@HI{{morau}} and is used when an action if performed
for the receiver by a person of higher social
status.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}@HI{{kudasaru}} is the honorific form of @Vte{{}}@HI{{kureru}} and is used when a person of higher
social status performs an action for the receiver.
