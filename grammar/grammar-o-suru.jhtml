</p>

<h2> Examples </h2>

<ol>
<li>
<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
    @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha @KJ{{before^life}} no @KT{{su-tsuke-su}}wo @EM{{o}}@KJ{{hold}}chi @EM{{shimashita}}.}}

  <tr class="en"> <td>
    I carried the teacher's suitcase.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</ol>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
This construction cannot be used with all verbs: some verbs express the humble form in irregular ways.
</p>

<p>
This form is used only to when the speaker's actions or those of his in-group affect someone to whom the
speaker wishes to show politeness. 
</p>

<p>
Verbs of the form @N{{}}@HI{{suru}} form the honorific as @HI{{go}}@N{{}}@HI{{suru}} or, even more politely, @HI{{go}}@N{{}}@HI{{itasu}}. There are a few exceptions that take @HI{{o}} rather than @HI{{go}}.
</p>

<p>
These verbs with an irregular humble form <em>can</em> be used even if the action does not affect someone
to whom the speaker wishes to show politeness.
