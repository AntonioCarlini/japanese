@BGRND{{}}
<p>
The imperative is used to command a person to do something and the prohibitive form is used to order
a person not to do something. Both forms have strong coercive overtones and as such their use is
limited.
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
These forms can be used by a father to his children or by a senior man may to his juniors. 

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{early}}ku @KJ{{sleep}}ro}}.
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Go to bed immediately.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
Males who are friends may use the imperative or prohibitive between themselves, in which case the sentence
ending particle @HI{{yo}} is often used to soften the utterance.

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{amari @KJ{{drink}}munayo.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Don't drink too much.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
Both forms may be used in situations when there is not enough time to be polite (for example, an emergency).

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{escape}}ro.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Run!
  </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When a command is required during training of many people, both the imperative and the prohibitive may be used.

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{rest}}muna.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Don't rest.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
Both forms may be heard in cheering at sports events. In this case, women may also use these forms.

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{defeat}}runa.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Don't lose.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
These forms are used when a strong impact or brevity is required, such as in traffic signs.

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{stop}}mare.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Stop.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
These forms can be used when giving instructions indirectly.

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{red^faith^nickname}}ha@KJ{{stop}}maretoiu@KJ{{idea^flavor}}desu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      A red traffic light means "Stop".
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRNDEND{{}}

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
Women do not usually use the imperative, instead they usually use <a href="grammar-nasai.html">@Vmasustem{{}}@HI{{nasai}}</a> when a male would
employ the imperative.
