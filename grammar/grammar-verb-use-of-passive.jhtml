<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
Japanese uses two forms of the passive. In <em>both</em> cases, the subject has no control over
the action described.

The <em> direct passive</em> corresponds to the use of the passive voice in English.
The <em>suffering passive</em> involves an action by an agent which affects the subject, often adversely.
</p>

<h3><a name="direct">Direct</a> Passive</h3>

@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When a sentence is stated from the viewpoint of the person towards whom an action is directed,
sentence pattern (A) with a passive verb is used. In this case the agent (performer of the action) is
marked by @HI{{ni}}.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha @KJ{{before^life}}ni @KJ{{praise}}meraremashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I was praised by my teacher.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When there is no need to mention the person who performs the action denoted by the verb,
sentence pattern (B) is often used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{day^book}}no@KJ{{car}}ha @KJ{{generation^world^in}}he @KJ{{transport^exit}}sarete imasu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Japanese cars are exported all over the world.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When something is created or discovered, sentence pattern (C) can be used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{[@KJ{{source^family*name^thing^word}}]ha @KJ{{purple^style}}bu ni yotte @KJ{{write}}karemashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      "The Tale of Genji" was written by Murasaki Shikibu.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When the agent can be considered to be a source in some way, then sentence pattern (D) can be used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha@KJ{{study^life}}kara@KJ{{day^book}}no@KJ{{large^study}}nokotowo@KJ{{hear}}kareta.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I was asked by the students about Japanese universities.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRNDEND{{}}

<h3><a name="suffering">Suffering</a> Passive</h3>

<p>
When a person's actions are directed towards an object belonging to a second person, and this
second person feels troubled or annoyed, sentence pattern (E) is used.


<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha @KJ{{younger*brother}}ni @KT{{pasokonn}}wo @KJ{{demolition}}saremashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I had my PC broken by my brother.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<h2> Notes</h2>

<p>
@EM{{Note that in the direct passive, the verb is always transitive.}}
</p>

<p>
The agent in the suffering passive is always marked by @HI{{ni}}.
</p>

<p>
An intransitive verb is permitted in the suffering passive.
