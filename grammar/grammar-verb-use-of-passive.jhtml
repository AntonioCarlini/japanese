<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
Japanese uses two forms of the passive. In <em>both</em> cases, the subject has no control over
the action described.

The <em> direct passive</em> corresponds to the use of the passive voice in English.
The <em>suffering passive</em> involves an action by an agent which affects the subject, often adversely.
</p>

<h3><a name="direct">Direct</a> Passive</h3>

@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When a sentence is stated from the viewpoint of the person towards whom an action is directed,
sentence pattern (A) with a passive verb is used. In this case the agent (performer of the action) is
marked by @HI{{ni}}.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha@KJ{{before^life}}ni@KJ{{praise}}meraremashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I was praised by my teacher.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When there is no need to mention the person who performs the action denoted by the verb,
sentence pattern (B) is often used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{day^book}}no@KJ{{car}}ha@KJ{{generation^world^in}}he@KJ{{transport^exit}}sareteimasu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Japanese cars are exported all over the world.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When something is created or discovered, sentence pattern (C) can be used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{[@KJ{{source^family*name^thing^word}}]ha@KJ{{purple^style}}buniyotte@KJ{{write}}karemashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      "The Tale of Genji" was written by Murasaki Shikibu.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When the agent can be considered to be a source in some way, then sentence pattern (D) can be used.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha@KJ{{study^life}}kara@KJ{{day^book}}no@KJ{{large^study}}nokotowo@KJ{{hear}}kareta.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I was asked by the students about Japanese universities.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRNDEND{{}}

<h3><a name="suffering">Suffering</a> Passive</h3>

@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
When a person's actions are directed towards an object belonging to a second person, and this
second person feels troubled or annoyed, sentence pattern (E) is used.


<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha@KJ{{younger*brother}}ni@KT{{pasokonn}}wo@KJ{{demolition}}saremashita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I had my PC broken by my brother.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
The suffering passive can be employed with an intransitive verb.


<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{watashiha@FG{{@KJ{{yesterday^day}}:kinou}}@KJ{{rain}}ni@FG{{@KJ{{descend}}:fu}}rarete,nureteshimatta.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I was rained on yesterday and got wet.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
The suffering passive can be employed with a transitive verb.


<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{watashino@KJ{{house}}no@KJ{{in*front}}ni@KT{{gomi}}wo@FG{{@KJ{{discard}}:su}}terarete@FG{{@KJ{{quandary}}:koma}}tteimasu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I have a problem with rubbish being dumped in front of my house.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>
