<h1>Use of the Causative</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @N{{person}} @HI{{wo}} @EM{{@Vsaseru{{}}}}(intransitive)
<li> @N{{person}} @HI{{ni}} @N{{}} @HI{{wo}} @EM{{@Vsaseru{{}}}}(transitive)
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
Causative verbs appear in two types of sentences: those which indicate the subject with @HI{{wo}} and
those which indicate it with @HI{{ni}}. With intransitive verbs @HI{{wo}} is used and with transitive
ones @HI{{ni}} is used.
</p>

<p>
Causatives indicate compulsion or permission. These sentence patterns are used when a senior person
requires or permits a junior person to do something. However, when the speaker tells someone from
outside his group that the speaker will make someone from within his group do somehting, the
causative is used regardless of status.
