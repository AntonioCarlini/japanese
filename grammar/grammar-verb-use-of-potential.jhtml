<h1>Use of the Potential</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @FORMATION{{@N{{}} @HI{{ga}} @Vreru{{}}}}
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

Potential verbs express states rather than  actions. The @HI{{wo}} used to mark the object
of a transitive verb becomes @HI{{ga}} when the verb is in the potential form.
<p></p>

A potential verb is used to express a person's ability to perform an action and to express
the possibility of a an action in a given situation.
<p></p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
@KJ{{see}}@HI{{ru}} forms the potential @KJ{{see}}@HI{{rareru}},
which means that one's intention of seeing can be realised.
</p>

<p>
@KJ{{hear}}@HI{{ku}} forms the potential @KJ{{hear}}@HI{{keru}},
which means that one's intention of listening can be realised.
</p>

<p>
<a href="grammar-mieru.html">@HI{{mieru}}</a>, on the other hand,
indicates that something can be seen independently of one's will and
<a href="grammar-kikoeru.html">@HI{{kikoeru}}</a> indicates that something can be heard independently of one's will.
These latter two verbs also take @HI{{ga}} to mark the object seen or head.
</p>

<p>
@HI{{wakaru}}, @HI{{iru}} (to need), @HI{{aru}}, @HI{{aku}} and @HI{{kusaru}} do not have potential forms.
