<h2> Formation </h2>

</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
@EM{{@HI{{kotoninaru}}}} indicates an event or decision that occurs irrespective of the speaker's
volition.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{private}}ha@KJ{{come^year^large^heights}}ni@KJ{{revolve^diligence}}suru@EM{{kotoninarimashita}}.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      It has been decided that next year I will transfer to Osaka.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
This construction can be used even if the experiencer chooses to do something as it sounds more indirect than simply stating directly that
the experiencer has made a decision and so is considered to be more polite. Compare with <a href="grammar-koto-ni-suru.html">@HI{{kotonisuru}}</a>.
</p>

<p>
Using @EM{{@HI{{kotoninatteiru}}}} shows that a decision took place at some point in the past and its results are still in effect. It may go so
far as to indicate that something has become a rule or a custom./

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>

  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Today (it has been arranged that) I'm seeing Professor Yamada.
  </td> </tr>
