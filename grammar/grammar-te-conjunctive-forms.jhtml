<h1>@HI{{te}} conjunctive forms</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @Vte{{}},
<li> @Aistem{{}}@HI{{kute}},
<li> @Anastem{{}}@HI{{de}},
<li> @N{{}}@HI{{de}},
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
The conjunctive forms are used to connect sentences. The sentences are joined in the order 
that the actions mentioned in them occur. The tense of the whole sentence is determined by
the tense form of the end ofthe sentence.
</p>

<p>
The @Vte{{}} form can be repeated more than once in a clause.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of a series of conjunctive forms is usually one of the following:
<ul>
<li> the predicates occur sequentially
<li> the predicates represent various states of something or someone
<li> the first predicate is the cause of or the reason for the second
<li> the first predicate is the means by which or the manner in which the second is realised
<li> the two predicates are contrasted
<li> the second predicate is unexpected, given the first
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These forms can be used to connect sentences with different topics. However, if the sentences
express contradictory notions, then this form cannot be used and <a href="grammar-ga-conjunction.html">@HI{{ga}}</a>
should be used instead.
</p>

<p>
@Vte{{}}-form is used as the basis for many other forms.
</p>
