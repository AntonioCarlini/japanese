@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
This sentence pattern expresses the speaker's regret and is often translated as "I wish I had done ...".
It is an idiomatic expression made up of a conditional clause and @HI{{yokatta}}; the literal meaning
is "if ~ had been done, it would have been good".

<table class="sentence" border=0>
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{before^life}}ni@KJ{{hear}}tebayokattadesu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      I wish I had asked my teacher.
  </td> </tr>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
In this construction @Vba{{}} expresses a condition that did not in fact happen in the past.

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
To express the idea that someone other than the speaker wishes that something had been done, use this expression
with @KJ{{think}}@HI{{u}}.

  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KT{{biru}}ha@KJ{{day^book}}he@KJ{{going}}kebayokattato@KJ{{think}}tteiru.}}

  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Bill thinks that it would have been good if he had gone to Japan.
  </td> </tr>

<p>
@EM{{@Vba{{}}@HI{{yokatta}}}} is most often used when the speaker is talking about themselves. However, it can be
used when the speaker is talking about the listener or a third party, in which case it sounds more natural with @HI{{noni}}
at the end of the sentence.

  <tr class="en"> <td>
