<h2> Definition </h2>

@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
@KJ{{oneself^part}} may be an empathy marker or it may be  a reflexive pronoun that refers back to a human subject, which is then contrasted with someone else.

@KJ{{oneself^part}} is a contrastive marker if any of the following is true:

<ol>
<li> the referent is an agent
<li> the subject is generic
<li> @KJ{{oneself^part}} cannot be replaced by an implicit or explicit 3rd person pronoun.
</ol>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
Here @KJ{{oneself^part}} is a contrastive marker.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{day^book^person}}ha@KJ{{oneself^part}}no@KJ{{country}}no@KJ{{sentence^change}}wo@KT{{yuni-ku}}
      dato@KJ{{think}}tteimasu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      The Japanese think that their country's culture is unique.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
If @KJ{{oneself^part}} does not satisy the conditions above then it is not a contrastive marker and is instead referring back
to a human subject with whom the speaker empathises.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@KJ{{soil^rice*field}}ha@KJ{{happiness^child}}ga@KJ{{oneself^part}}wo@KJ{{love}}shiteirukotowo@KJ{{know}}rimasendeshita.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Tsuchida didn't know that Sachiko loved him.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
The referent of @KJ{{oneself^part}} has to be conscious of the sitaution expressed in the main clause.
This sentence is acceptable because @KJ{{friend^child}} is alive when her child enters university.
Had the child entered university after @KJ{{friend^child}} died, the sentence would have to be recast to not use @KJ{{oneself^part}}.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@FG{{@KJ{{friend^child}}:tomoko}}ha@KJ{{oneself^part}}ga@FG{{@KJ{{death}}:shi}}nu@KJ{{in*front}}ni@KJ{{child^submit}}ga@KJ{{large^study}}ni@KJ{{enter}}tta.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Before Tomoko died, her child entered university.
  </td> </tr>
