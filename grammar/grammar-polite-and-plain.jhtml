<h1>Polite and Plain Styles</h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
If a sentence predicate uses @HI{{desu}} or @HI{{masu}} then it is considered to be in the polite (or formal) style. Otherwise
it is in the plain (or casual or informal) style.
</p>

<p>
The polite style may be used to anybody at any time. It is commonly used between adults who are not close friends. It is
used towards adults whom one has just met for the first time, to one's superiors in society and to any adult to whom
one does not feel close. It may also optionally be used when talking to younger people or those lower in rank.
</p>

<p>
The plain style is used when talking to one's close friends, colleagues and family members. It is also used in written work
such as newspapers, books, theses and diaries. Letters, however, are usually written in the polite style.
</p>

<h2> Chaarcteristics of the plain style </h2>

<ol>
<li> questions usually omit @HI{{ka}}, ending instead in a rising intonation.
<li> in noun and @HI{{na}}-adjective questions, @HI{{da}} is usually omitted.
<li> particles are often omitted if the meaning of the sentence is still clear.
<li> @V{{}}@HI{{te iru}} often becomes @V{{}}@HI{{teru}}.
<li> @HI{{kedo}} is used as a conjunction rather than @HI{{ga}}.
</ol>
