<li> @FORMATION{{<em>name</em>@HI{{@EM{{kunn}}}}}}
<li> @FORMATION{{<em>name or noun</em>@HI{{@EM{{sama}}}}}}

<h2> Definition </h2>

@BGRNDSTART{{}}

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
<a name="san">@HI{{@EM{{sann}}}}</a> is added as a suffix to the name of the listener or to a third person, or to nouns
describing these, to show the speaker's respect for the person. It is <em>never</em> used by the speaker when
referring to himself. Note that in Japanese speech the pronoun for "you", @HI{{anata}}, is not often used;
instead refer to the listener by using their family name followed by @HI{{sann}} or by an appropriate title.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{ano@KJ{{direction}}ha @KT{{mira-}}@EM{{sann}}desu.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      That's Mr. Miller.
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
<a name="kun">@HI{{@EM{{kunn}}}}</a> is added as a suffix to the first or last name of a male of equal rank or to the first or last name
of a person of lower rank. This suffix is often used in schools and at work.
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
<a name="sama">@HI{{@EM{{sama}}}}</a> is a suffix which indicates a high degree of politeness by the speaker towards another
individual. The original meaning was "appearance" and the high degree of politeness comes about because this allows the speaker to
refer to a superior indirectly.
<p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
<a name="o">@HI{{@EM{{o}}}}</a> can be added to some words in order to show respect for another person.

<table class="sentence">
  <tr class="jp"> <td>
      @HI{{@EM{{o}}@KJ{{country}}hadochiradesuka.}}
  </td> </tr>
  <tr class="en"> <td>
      Where are you from?
  </td> </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
@HI{{@EM{{o}}}} cannot be used with nouns or adjectives that already begin with @HI{{o}}, with long words
or with foreign words. There are a very few exceptions to this rule.
</p>

@BGRND{{}}
<p>
<a name="go">@HI{{@EM{{go}}}}</a> can be added to some words in order to show respect for another person.
</p>

@BGRNDEND{{}}

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
There are some words where an initial @HI{{o}} is used as a matter of course and no longer indicates any particular respect.
Common examples are @HI{{ocha}} and @HI{{okane}}.
