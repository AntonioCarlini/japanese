<a name="taitei">@HI{{@EM{{tatei}}}}</a> is an adverb in Japanese that generally means "usually," "mostly," or "for the most part." It is used to describe a situation or characteristic that is true in the majority of cases, but not necessarily always.

<br/>

@HI{{@EM{{tatei}}}} is used when you want to convey that something happens or is true in the majority of cases, but there’s an implication that it’s not always the case. It can also suggest that something is generally the norm.
