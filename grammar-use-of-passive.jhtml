<h2> Definition </h2>

When a sentence is stated from the viewpoint of the person towards whom an action is directed,
sentence pattern A with a passive verb is used. In this case the performer of the action is
marked by @HI{{ni}}.
<p></p>

When a person's actions are directed towards an object belonging to a second person, and this
second person feels troubled or annoyed, sentence pattern B is used.
<p></p>

When there is no need to mention the person who performs the action denoted by the verb,
sentence pattern C is often used.
<p></p>

When something is created or discovered, sentence pattern D can be used.
