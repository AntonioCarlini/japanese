<h1>Honorific and Humble Language</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

@include{{"honorific-humble-verbs-table.inc"}}

<h2> Definition </h2>

The speaker is often expected to show respect for other people and Japanese uses three sorts of devices to achieve this:
<ul>
<li> @HI{{sonkeigo}} are expressions of respect for another party
<li> @HI{{kenjougo}} are expressions that the speaker uses to humble himself
<li> @HI{{teineigo}} are expressions of politeness
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3> @HI{{sonkeigo}} </h3>

@HI{{sonkeigo}} is used when referring to the other party's actions or state and serves show respect to that party.
<p></p>

Verbs are affected in one of two ways.
<p></p>

<h4> Passive verbs as @HI{{sonkeigo}} </h4>
Passive verbs are considered to be respectful. 
<p></p>

<h4> @HI{{o ~ ni naru}} </h4>

The @HI{{o ~ ni naru}} construction can be used for most verbs to produce a respectful form of most verbs. This form is considered
to be more respectful than using the passive.

<h4> Special Respectful Verb Forms </h4>

The @HI{{o ~ ni naru}} construction cannot be used with some verbs. These verbs have special respectful forms, as shown
in the table above. These are considered to have the same level of respectfulness as  the @HI{{o ~ ni naru}} construction.

<h4> Nouns, Adjectives and Adverbs </h4>

Nouns, adjectives and adverbs also have a respectful form. This is formed by prefixing with @HI{{o}} or @HI{{go}}.
