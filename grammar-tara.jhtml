<h1>@HI{{tara}}</h1>

<h2> Formation </h2>

<ol>
<li> @Vta{{}}@EM{{@HI{{ra}}}}
<li> @Aistem{{}}katta@EM{{@HI{{ra}}}}
<li> @Anastem{{}}datta@EM{{@HI{{ra}}}}
<li> @N{{}}datta@EM{{@HI{{ra}}}}
<li> @HI{{moshi}} ... @HI{{ta}}@EM{{@HI{{ra}}}}
</ol>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p>
When @EM{{@HI{{ra}}}} is attached to the plain past form of verbs, adjectives and nouns, it
changes the preceding clause into a conditional expression. When a speaker wishes to state his opinion, request
etc. in the conditional, this pattern is used. It is translated as "if ...".
</p>

<p>
@EM{{@Vta{{}}@HI{{ra}}}} can also be used to express that a certain action will be done or a
certain situation will appear when something which is sure to happen in the future has been completed.
In this case it is translated as "when ...". The main clause in this pattern is always in the present tense.
</p>

<p>
To distinguish the "if" case from the "when" case, remember that if the subordiante clause represents a
certainty then the expression means "when", otherwise it means "if".
</p>

<p>
The main clause <em>can</em> contain a request, suggestion, command or volition.
</p>

<p>
In both these constructions, the subordinate clause represents something that logically precedes the main clause.
If this is not the case then this sentence pattern cannot be used.
</p>

<p>
@HI{{moshi}} can be placed before the subordinate clause to indicate that a condition is about to be presented.
@HI{{moshi}} implies that an emphasis is on the speaker's supposition.
</p>
